## 2D Ray Tracing with Light and Reflection Simulation 

A simple Pygame light ray simulator. Watch the rays spread out from your cursor and interact with the objects.

* Draw obstacles: Right-click and drag the mouse to create obstacles that light rays will interact with.
* Reflect: Left-click to toggle reflections
* Rotate: Space to rotate the light rays for some trippy effects :)
* Dim: D to simulate the decrease in intensity of light after a certain number of reflections
* Increase/decrease rays: Use the scroll wheel to change the ray count
* Change rotation speed: Up/Down arrows
* Change light colours: C
