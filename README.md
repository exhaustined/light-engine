## 2D Ray Tracing with Light and Reflection Simulation 
![ezgif-7-f4ce1df5e1](https://github.com/exhaustined/light-engine/assets/74151370/983aa7a5-b50b-48e0-b26b-7beff26f7cb0)

A simple Pygame light ray simulator. Watch the rays spread out from your cursor and interact with the objects.

## Controls
* Draw obstacles: Right-click and drag the mouse to **_create obstacles_** that light rays will interact with.
* Reflect: Left-click to toggle **_reflections_**
* Rotate: Space to **_rotate_** the light rays for some trippy effects :)
* Dim: D to simulate the **_decrease in intensity_** of light after a certain number of reflections
* Increase/decrease dim rate: Adjust after **_how many bounces_** the ray should reduce in brightness. Left/Right arrows
* Increase/decrease rays: Use the scroll wheel to change the **_ray count_**
* Change rotation speed: Up/Down arrows to adjust **_rotation speed_**
* Change light colours: C
